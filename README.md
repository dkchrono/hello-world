# hello-world
First-time repository created in conjuction with the Hello World GitHub Guide
At the point of the first commit, there are no source files in the branch.  All that's
present is READ.ME (this file)

I've decided to add some more text here.  This is after the initial commit, so what this
amounts to is a change to the project (which still contains just this one file) that 
will be added to the respoitory with a second commit.

Here's an additional comment made after the pull request was opened.
